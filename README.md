# The C Programming Language 2nd

Simply the code, be it examples from the book or answers to exercises, from the classic book.

I have no intention to become and be a professional programmer.
I am not a student from computer science.
I am just trying to learn whatever technology I am courious about.

Therefore it will take a long time before finally in my GitHub appears my own projects. 
C is just one of such technologies that attract me so much that I cannot help but to learn it.

I code for fun.
