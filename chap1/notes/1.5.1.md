- to get user's input, using [[`getchar()`]]
	- `int c = getchar()`
- to output user's input, using [[`putchar()`]]
	- `putchar(c)`
- why does the example use `int` rather than `char` to define `c`?
	- `c` must be big enough to hold a stream of characters of any length plus a final `EOF`.
- what is `EOF`?
	- an [[integer]] defined in `stdio.h` 
	- the specific value of it does not matter as long as it is different from any `char` value
	- >By using the symbolic constant, we are assured that nothing in the program depends on the specific numeric value.
- logic operator `!=` precedence is higher than `=`
